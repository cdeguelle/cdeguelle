🚀 I am a full stack developper and currently student at [O'clock](https://oclock.io/) 🚀

⌛ After 3 years working in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and being passionate about the web and new technologies, I decided to go back to school and train in a field that fascinates me. I therefore turned to training with the Openclassrooms school which ended in success, so I obtained a license as a Front-end Developer and acquired all the skills necessary to exercise this profession.

📚 I am now turning to another training course with the O'clock school as a full stack developer to increase my skills and gain professional experience.

🚀 I also work as a freelance developer on some ongoing projects.
