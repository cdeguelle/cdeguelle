🚀 I am a full stack developper and currently open for work 🚀

⌛ After 3 years working in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and being passionate about the web and new technologies, I decided to go back to school and train in a field that fascinates me. I therefore turned to training with the few schools and programs which ended in success, so I obtained a license as a Front-end Developer and acquired all the skills necessary to exercise this profession.

🚀 I also work as a freelance developer on some ongoing projects.
